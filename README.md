ðŸ‘‰ [First beta release here](https://github.com/Graish75/truckersmpPlayersLookup/releases/tag/1.0_beta1)

**This** project aims to create a better and faster way to search, discover and identify players just by simply searching them by every possible method.
The searching methods currently implemented are either via the **TruckersMP ID** or the **Steam ID**, but I'm currently working in also implementing other searching methods such as **Username** and **Discord ID**.

For every player you are able to retrieve this informations currently, everything thanks to the TruckersMP's public API:
  - Username
  - SteamID
  - TMPID
  - If the player is currently banned
  - The group the user is currently part of (e.g. Player, Report Moderator, etc..)
  - When the account got created
